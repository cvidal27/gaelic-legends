    Oft the savage Tale in telling
    Less of Love than Wrath and Hate,
    Hath within its fierceness dwelling
    Some pure note compassionate.

    Mark, if rude their nature, stronger,
    Manlier are the minds that keep
    Thought on rightful vengeance longer
    Than on those who can but weep.

    Better sing the horrid battle
    Than its cause of crime and wrong;
    Sing great life-deeds! the death-rattle
    Is too common for a song.

    Lays where man in fight rejoices
    Sang our Sires, from Sire to Son;
    Heard and loved the hero voices,
    "Dare, and more than life is won!"
